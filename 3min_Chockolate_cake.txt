3 MINUTE CHOCOLATE COFFEE MUG CAKE!! ( LARGE mug)

4 tablespoons flour 
4 tablespoons sugar 
2 tablespoons cocoa 
1 egg 
3 tablespoons milk 
3 tablespoons oil 
3 tablespoons chocolate chips (optional) 
A small splash of vanilla essence 
1 large coffee mug

Add dry ingredients to your largest mug and mix well. Add the egg and mix thoroughly. Pour in the milk and oil and mix well. Add the chocolate chips (if using), vanilla essence , then mix again.

Put your mug in the microwave and cook for 3 minutes at high. The cake will rise over the top of the mug, but don't be alarmed! 

Allow to cool a little, and tip out onto a plate if desired.

EAT! (this can serve 2 if you want to feel slightly more virtuous). 

And why is this the most dangerous cake recipe in the world? 
Because now you are only 5 minutes away from chocolate cake 
at any time of the day or night! You are going to forward this straight away, aren't you ... :-).
